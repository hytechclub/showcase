<p> I like Minecraft, I think its a genuienly good game with good mechanics. I just hate how braty the fandom can be though saying it was never good after it left beta 1.7.3 or something like that. i personally dont think thats really the case but like. \_(._.)_/</p>

<p>if the image LOADS, what you see is one of the first five Snowdon Mountain Railway locomotives, basically before the newer superheated engines were ordered. number 5 Moel Siabod (weird name i know >_>) built in roughly 1896 and rebuilt/restored to working order in 2017. it was built to scale up snowdown mountain this is possible due to the rails have racks in them and the enignes having pinion wheels so they click together and the engines on the railway dont slip while scaling the mountain. This technique is import for scaling such a big mountain constantly every day for years. In fact, the railway had to be temporarily closed after a freak accident on opening day when their Number 1 "L.A.D.A.S." derails and rolled down the mountain, a complete wreck was what was left of it, the only salvagable parts of L.A.D.A.S. were its wheels on connecting rods</p>
