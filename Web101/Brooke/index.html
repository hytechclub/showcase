      <h4>List of adaptations that will be on this website:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Angry Birds Movie</li>
        
        <li>Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</li>
        <li>Sonic the Hedgehog</li>
        <li>Super Mario Bros. (1993. They may be making a new one.)</li>
        <li>Pokemon (I'm going to put them all in here as one.)</li>
        <li>Detective Pikachu</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: I have seen more, though these are the only ones on the list. I only chose one adaptation per game. Some of these ratings may also be tainted by nostalgia.</p>

            <p>It had its fun moments, but when it came to being an adaptation, as a long time Angry Birds fan, I felt like they could have had a little more fan service with the birds. It wasa good enough stand alone movie though.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed this show. It kept me entertained and I had fun watching it and seeing how the plot progressed. The major issue I had was the fact that when the animation style switched from 2d to 3d in the middle of episodes, it broke some emersion. Otherwise, it is a fun and interesting adaptation!</p>

            <h5>"Fun to watch, but missing something for Sonic enjoyers."</h5>
            <p>As I have said in my quote, the movie was fun with a good plot and had many jokes that Sonic fans would understand over the average viewer, though I feel like some of the world could have had more "Sonic" to it, similar to how the TV show Sonic X brought Sonic to the human world. It looks like the second movie will have more for the fans, though I haven't seen it yet. This movie has potential to do a lot with the proper care and the team seems to care due to their fixes of Sonic's original design when the trailers came out.</p>

            <h5>"A true disgrace to Mario."</h5>
            <p>I would have used the Super Mario Brothers Super Show as the reveiw for mario because I have more nostalgia for that one, but I decided to review the Super Mario Bros. Movie from 1993 because I have seen it and want to share my pain with the world. I saw it once when I was young, meaning I had a lower standard for movies and shows, and I thought, "Wow. This is not Mario." The movie is trying to be something that Mario isn't, which is the downfall of the movie. It is not Mario and anyone who would want to watch this movie could see that from the start.</p>

            <h5>"A great series with no mystery as to how it has gone on for so long."</h5>
            <p>Its no wonder that this show has gone on for so long. The show is enjoyable in almost every season and the characters are fun. It is a great representaition of Pokemon as a game series and a great adaptation, where the TV series is as iconic as the games themselves. Overall a great series made just for Pokemon fans. One of the places where most series fail </p>

            <p>The detective Pikachu movie was fun and clearly had a lot of effort put into it from all of the small background details. Pleanty of fan service is scatterd throughout the movie. I enjoyed it and thought that it was a good addition among the ranks of pokemon movies.</p>
