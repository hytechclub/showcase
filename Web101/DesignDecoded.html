                    <p class="article-text">
                        Each year, Pantone chooses a color that they predict will become incorporated into trends and
                        lifestyles of the entire population around the globe. It indicates to stores that the color is
                        selling and will appear everywhere from clothing to furniture. Therefore, it is very important
                        to interior designers because it dictates what colors and designs are in style for that year and
                        it gives them ideas as to what trends clients will want. </p>

                    <h3>Minimalist Interior Design: Embracing Simplicity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Minimalist interior design, born in the mid-20th century, champions simplicity and
                        functionality. Rooms feature neutral colors like whites and grays, promoting a serene atmosphere
                        and maximizing space and light. Furniture is chosen for clean lines and minimalism, often with
                        integrated storage solutions. Emphasizing spaciousness, minimalist design uses ample negative
                        space and favors natural light through large windows. This style aims to create tranquil,
                        uncluttered environments that foster a sense of calm and clarity in daily living. </p>
