<h1>About SpongeBob XP</h1>
<p>I hate to disappoint you, assuming you probably didn't know this, but SpongeBob XP is not a real virtual machine nor a hidden Windows XP easter egg. What I do like to tell you though is that it's a passion project of mine for Web 102 of Hy-Tech club. All the windows like Internet Explorer or Paint and this "Virtual Machine" is done thanks to iframes. A sacred element that this project would be way more difficult if not impossible without it. I used inspect element on a couple of websites to see how they achieve a couple things like putting elements in rows or columns, using images as borders for elements, and some couple javascript tricks like progress bars as you see in the blue screen. There were a couple challenges that have been a pain for me to overcome such as getting the windows to function and making the "Virtual Machine" keep its aspect ratio and size in fullscreen. I'd like to thank all of you for your support and being there during Web 102.</p>
  <p>To all Web 102 students looking forward into going to Web 103, good luck on your journey.</p>
  <p>Sincerely, George Boutros, the person behind SpongeBob XP :)</p>
